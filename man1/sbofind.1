.P
sbofind searches the names of all slackbuilds for a given term. It reports back any slackbuilds found along with the path for each. This is equivalent to running "cd /usr/ports; make search name=$search_term display=name,path" on a FreeBSD system. For a more general search, the slackbuilds.org site should be consulted, where tags also exist and are included in the searched fields.
